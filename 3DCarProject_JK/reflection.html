	<h1>Matchbox Replica Reflection</h1>
	<p>This reflection is all about my first 3D printing project where I had to replicate a Matchbox Car. We utilized a website called OnShape to design my car to be 3D printed.</p>
	<h2>Process:</h2>
	<h4>Here are the project steps:</h4>
  <p>Design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Obtain a matchbox car</li>
    <li>Use calipers to measure the exact size (length, width, height) of the car</li>
    <li>Use these measurements as well as your car to make a engineering drawing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>3D Modeling:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use OnShape to create a box with the same dimesions of your car</li>
    <li>Download sketches from your engineering drawing and trace them on each side of the box accordingly</li>
    <li>Use the extrusion tool to remove space from the box to create car shape</li>
    <li>Use other tools to refine your car and make it look as similar to the original model as possible by using fillets and other tools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prepare and Slice File</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a CAD Drawing of the model </li>
    <li>Prepare to slice the file in Cura </li>
  </ul>
  <p>3D Print </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the model from Cura, print the car </li>
    <li>Compare to initial matchbox car and take notes on what you could have done better </li>
    <li>Upload pictures to the slidedeck </li>
  </ul>
	<h2>Setbacks and Solutions:</h2>
	<p> Here are my setbacks and solutions</p>
