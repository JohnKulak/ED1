	<h1>Matchbox Replica Reflection</h1>
  <p>This reflection is all about my first 3D printing project where I had to replicate a Matchbox Car. We utilized a website called OnShape to design my car to be 3D printed.</p>
	<h2>Process:</h2>
	<h4>Here are the project steps:</h4>
  <p>Design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Obtain a matchbox car</li>
    <li>Use calipers to measure the exact size (length, width, height) of the car</li>
    <li>Use these measurements as well as your car to make a engineering drawing</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <p>3D Modeling:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use OnShape to create a box with the same dimesions of your car</li>
    <li>Download sketches from your engineering drawing and trace them on each side of the box accordingly</li>
    <li>Use the extrusion tool to remove space from the box to create car shape</li>
    <li>Use other tools to refine your car and make it look as similar to the original model as possible by using fillets and other tools</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <p>Prepare and Slice File:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a CAD Drawing of the model </li>
    <li>Prepare to slice the file in Cura </li>
  </ul>
  <figure>
    <img src = "Cura.PNG" alt = "Drawing" style = "width: 50%">
    <figcaption> Cura: picture before slicing </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>3D Print:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the model from Cura, print the car </li>
    <li>Compare to initial matchbox car and take notes on what you could have done better </li>
    <li>Upload pictures to the slidedeck </li>
  </ul>

	<h2>Setbacks and Solutions:</h2>
	<p> Here are my setbacks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In my personal opinion this has been one of my favorite projects yet; however, it was also the most challenging, so it came with its fair share of stuggles. The first setback I encountered came while I was working on my 3D envelope. I noticed(see picture below) that my engineering drawing was not the exact same measurements. As a result, my car could not be the exact measuremnts of the original car.</li>
    <li>Another problem I ran into came while I was doing my fillets on my extruded car. While I was doing my fillets, there where multiple times when it would say that the fillets I wanted would not work, although it is what I needed for my car to look the best</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <p>Here are my solutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In response to my first problem I improvised. By that, I mean that since my engineering drawings were very close to the actually values of height,length,and width that I actually needed, I was able to expirement with tools and adjust things. This resulted in having a 0% margin of error in my height and width, and only having a 1.8% margin of error on my length.</li>
    <li>In response to my second problem, I used bunch of expirementation. Since I really didn't know the tools that well I knew that if I expiremented for a bit, I would eventually come across what I needed to make my car look the best it could. After all of my expirements it turned out extremely well(see below).</li>
  </ul>
